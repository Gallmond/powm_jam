//TODO

x animate sky obstacle (and make reusable animation code)
- rules around frequency and position
- auto obstacles
- collison
- death screen
- score

//BUGS
- ground does not slide at correct pace (or obstacles dont?)
- the up key returns true but is not triggering jump if statement?

//notes
How often can obstacles randomly spawn
- not within one second of last obstacle
